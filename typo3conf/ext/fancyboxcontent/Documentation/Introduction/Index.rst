What does it do?
================

The extension includes fancyBox2 (http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) and the possibility to show content in the lightbox.

You can add content elements, an external url, media like YouTube or Vimeo and pure HTML. Additionally you can define the link type (text or image) and add some option to change the look and behaviour of the fancyBox.
