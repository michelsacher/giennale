============

Just install the extension through the extension manager and include the static TypoScript to your root page and you're ready to go.

Addtionally you can set some settings in the TypoScript constant manager. t3jquery is supported.
You can add the plugin to any TYPO3 page and everything there should be self-explanatory.
